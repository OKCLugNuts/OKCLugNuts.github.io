Sorry for the late notice, our usual meetup organizer fell ill (he's starting to feel better) and with all the Kansas Linux Fest (KLF) preparations, the Meetup situation slipped my notice.  There WILL be a meeting this Friday (for those not making the pilgrimage to KLF this weekend),  ~7PM at StarSpace46 ( <https://goo.gl/maps/nMxbhf4ohxq>).

This month, John Robertson will do his talk on Linux Performance Tools.

As always, anyone interested in anything open source is welcome to attend. Do not hesitate to bring any questions you have or computers you would like us to work on.  We look forward to seeing everyone here or at KLF!
