It is that time again, LUGNuts time.  With weather cooperating this month, I can confidently confirm this month's meeting at the usual date/time, which will be this Friday at ~7PM at StarSpace46 1141 W Sheridan Ave, Oklahoma City, OK 73106 ( [https://goo.gl/maps/JdtJXswuszG2][startspace46-map] ) in the event space (with the garage doors), which is located at the North side of the building, behind the nice new fence (do not expect to be let in/noticed through any other access point).

Thomas will provide a bit of a gaming theme again this month as he show-and-tells his brand-spanking-new Pi3Cart, which is the product of a recent successful Kickstarter project for building a full-powered and properly cooled Raspberry Pi 3 into an original NES game cartridge.  And the NES-PC may make an appearance again by popular demand.

I'll leave it at that for this update, but we should have more in store for you, as usual.

As always, anyone interested in anything open source is welcome to attend. Do not hesitate to bring any questions you have or computers you would like us to work on. We look forward to seeing everyone!
