This being Oklahoma, we're keeping an eye on the weather.  We do have plans for a meeting currently, but if the ice storm threat doesn't improve, or gets worse, the closer we get to the day, we'll revisit that decision for safety's sake.

As is, Patrick has offered a talk on networking with Samba (SMB) and NFS (the main Windows and Linux network communication protocols, respectively), which, unless you only ever need a single computer and hate the internet, you'll encounter constantly.  I always look forward to finding out anything more on this subject I can.

We'll let you know more as forecasts solidify, for now we'll plan to see you ~7PM this Friday at StarSpace46 1141 W Sheridan Ave, Oklahoma City, OK 73106 ( [https://goo.gl/maps/JdtJXswuszG2][startspace46-map] ) in the event space, which is located at the North side of the building with the garage doors (do not expect to be let in through any other access point).

As always, anyone interested in anything open source is welcome to attend. Do not hesitate to bring any questions you have or computers you would like us to work on. We look forward to seeing everyone, and if not, stay safe!
