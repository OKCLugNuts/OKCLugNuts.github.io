This Friday is our regularly scheduled meeting, ~7PM at StarSpace46 1141 W Sheridan Ave, Oklahoma City, OK 73106 ( [https://goo.gl/maps/JdtJXswuszG2][startspace46-map] ).  There's still some discussion about which room will be available to us, so we'll post entry instructions at the main door.

Our Meetup page ( [https://www.meetup.com/OKC-LUGnuts/][Meetup-OKCLugnuts] ) is quickly becoming the standard location for our meeting announcements, Google+ now serves more as a reminder for those that use the service and, of course, it serves to contribute many social aspects.  For timely updates and announcements, please follow us on Meetup, and RSVPing there can greatly assist us when it comes to what sized rooms are made available to us.

This month, John will be giving us his intro talk into highly available servers and some of the tools he uses to make them.

And maybe the super-rare (and newly announced to be officially discontinued) Linux-based NES Classic console could make an appearance...

As always, anyone interested in anything open source is welcome to attend. Do not hesitate to bring any questions you have or computers you would like us to work on. We look forward to seeing everyone!
