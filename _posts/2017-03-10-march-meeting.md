This Friday we will hold our regularly scheduled meeting, ~7PM at StarSpace46 1141 W Sheridan Ave, Oklahoma City, OK 73106 ( [https://goo.gl/maps/JdtJXswuszG2][startspace46-map] ) UPDATE:  we are apparently in a conference room this time, rather than the usual Event Space, so we'll keep an eye on the main building doors for member entry.

Also, as an alternate/early meeting notification source and to give us a heads up if you think you're coming, consider visiting our Meetup page!  [https://www.meetup.com/OKC-LUGnuts/][Meetup-OKCLugnuts]

This month Greg will be talking about his experiences and comparing the Raspberry Pi 1 vs the Sparc1!  Plus I'm sure the Pi3Cart will make a return appearance.

As always, anyone interested in anything open source is welcome to attend. Do not hesitate to bring any questions you have or computers you would like us to work on. We look forward to seeing everyone!
